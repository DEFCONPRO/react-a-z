# Project Contribution

1. **Descriptive Commit Messages**: When making changes, ensure that your commit messages are descriptive and explain what changes you've made. For example: "Fix nested Routes warning in FeedbackDetails component."

2. **Branch Naming**: When creating a new branch, use a naming convention that reflects the nature of the changes you're making. For example: `feature/new-feature` or `bugfix/fix-issue`.

3. **Code Formatting**: Follow consistent code formatting throughout the project. If the project uses a specific code style (indentation, spacing, etc.), adhere to it. Use a linter if available to catch formatting issues.

4. **Comments**: Use comments to explain complex logic or any code that might not be immediately clear to other contributors. Comments should be concise and helpful.

5. **Documentation**: If you're adding new features or modifying existing ones, update the relevant documentation to reflect the changes. This could include updating the README.md file or inline code comments.

6. **Testing**: If the project has automated tests, make sure your changes don't break the existing tests. If you're adding new features, consider adding corresponding tests.

7. **Pull Requests**: When creating a pull request, provide a clear description of the changes you've made, the problem you've solved, and any potential impacts.

8. **Dependencies**: If you're adding new dependencies, ensure they are necessary and compatible with the project. Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies.

9. **Consistency**: Maintain consistency in coding style, naming conventions, and patterns across the project. Follow the conventions set by the existing codebase.

10. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling where necessary. This could include handling network requests, user input, and potential edge cases.

11. **Modularization**: Keep your code modular and organized. Divide functionality into functions, components, or modules as appropriate.

12. **Testing**: If the project has automated tests, make sure your changes don't break the existing tests. If you're adding new features, consider adding corresponding tests.

13. **Performance**: Write code that is performant and efficient. Avoid unnecessary computations and optimize where needed.

14. **Security**: Follow best practices for security, such as avoiding hardcoding sensitive information and protecting against common vulnerabilities.

15. **Pull Request Review**: Be open to feedback from other contributors. Address comments and suggestions during the review process.

16. **License**: Respect the project's open-source license. Ensure that your contributions align with the licensing terms.

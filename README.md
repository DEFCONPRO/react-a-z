## Description

Here there's the client-side routing using React Router and it contains private routes that are protected and only accessible to authenticated users. Here's an explanation, with a focus on the Private Routes, based on the code you provided:

1. **React Router Setup**:

   The application uses React Router (`BrowserRouter`, `Route`, and `Routes`) for client-side routing. It defines various routes for different pages and components.

2. **Public Routes**:

   - Routes for the `About`, `ServerError` (500 error), and `NotFoundError` (404 error) pages are declared using the `Route` component.

   - Routes for the `Signin` and `Register` pages are also declared using the `Route` component.

3. **Private Routes**:

   - The `PrivateRoutes` component is used as a layout for private routes. It wraps the routes that should be protected and only accessible to authenticated users.

   - Inside the `PrivateRoutes` component, several routes are declared, including the home page (`/`), a blog page (`/blog`), and a detail page (`/details/:id/*`).

   - The `PrivateRoutes` component checks the user's authentication status before rendering the protected routes. If a user is not authenticated (not logged in), they will be redirected to the login page (`/signin`).

4. **Token Expiry Handling**:

   - While the code for token expiration handling isn't provided in the snippets, there are indications that the application handles token expiration. If a user's access token is expired or missing, they will be redirected to the login page (`/signin`).

5. **Spinner for Loading**:

   - The `PrivateRoutes` component includes a loading spinner (an image) that is displayed when checking the user's authentication status. This provides feedback to the user while their login status is being verified.

6. **Login and Registration Routes**:

   - The `Signin` and `Register` routes are available for users to log in or register for a new account.

7. **Error Handling**:

   - Routes for server errors (`/500`) and not found errors (`*`) are defined to handle different error scenarios.

The actual server-side implementation is responsible for user authentication and authorization, including token validation and user data management.

## Installation

To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-front-to-back`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Usage

The code snippet below illustrates the process of acquiring identical code from this repository onto your local machine.

```bash
# Clone the remote Git repository
git clone https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back.git

# Change the current directory to the cloned repository's directory
cd react-front-to-back

# Install project dependencies using npm
npm install

# Start the application server
npm start

# List all remote branches
git branch -r

# Switch to a specific branch (replace <branch-name> with the desired branch name)
git checkout <branch-name> # for example: git checkout 35-refactor
```

The provided commands are used to clone a remote Git repository, navigate to the cloned repository's directory, install its dependencies, start the application server, list remote branches, and switch to a specific branch.

Here's a breakdown of each command:

1. `git clone https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back.git`: This command clones the remote Git repository from the URL `https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back` to your local machine. It creates a new directory named `react-front-to-back.git` and copies the entire repository contents into that directory.

2. `cd react-front-to-back.git`: This command changes the current working directory to the `react-front-to-back.git` directory. After executing this command, you will be inside the project directory.

3. `npm install`: This command installs the dependencies required by the application. It reads the `package.json` file in the project directory and installs all the packages listed in the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections.

4. `npm start`: This command starts the application server. The specific behavior of this command depends on how it is configured in the `package.json` file. Typically, it will run the application server and make it accessible at a specific port, allowing you to interact with the application in your web browser.

5. `git branch -r`: This command lists all the remote branches in the Git repository. Remote branches are branches that exist on the remote repository (in this case, on GitHub) and not on your local machine.

6. `git checkout <branch-name>`: This command is used to switch to a specific branch. Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to switch to. After executing this command, you will be on the specified branch, and you can start working on that branch.

In summary, these commands are commonly used to clone a Git repository, set up a local development environment by installing dependencies, start the application server, and switch to a specific branch to work on a particular feature or bug fix.

## Issue

In case you come across the error "Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'package-name' in 'your/path/here'", address this by running the command `npm install` (and consider restarting the development server if needed). This action will guarantee the installation of the required dependencies, successfully resolving the issue.

## Description

### Advantages of Axios over Fetch

Here we demonstrate the use of Axios in a React application compared to using the browser's native `fetch` API. Here are the key differences and advantages of using Axios:

1. **Simplicity and Consistency**: Axios provides a simpler and more consistent API for making HTTP requests compared to the `fetch` API. With Axios, you don't need to worry about handling different HTTP methods or headers manually; it abstracts these details for you.

2. **Error Handling**: Axios simplifies error handling by automatically rejecting the promise on HTTP error responses (e.g., status codes 4xx and 5xx). This allows you to use a single `try...catch` block to handle errors uniformly across requests.

3. **Response Data**: Axios automatically parses the response data, making it accessible directly as `response.data`. With `fetch`, you need to call methods like `response.json()` to parse the response manually.

4. **Interceptors**: Axios provides interceptor support, allowing you to intercept requests or responses globally before they are handled. This can be useful for tasks like adding authentication headers or handling errors globally.

5. **Cancellation**: Axios supports request cancellation, which can be essential for handling situations where you want to cancel a pending request when a component unmounts or when a new request should replace an ongoing one.

6. **Timeouts**: Axios allows you to set request timeouts easily, ensuring that a request does not hang indefinitely.

7. **CSRF Protection**: Axios can handle Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection by including anti-CSRF tokens in requests, if necessary.

In the code:

- You import Axios with `import axios from 'axios';`.
- You use Axios to make both POST and GET requests. Axios abstracts away the details of setting headers and parsing responses.
- Error handling is simplified with `try...catch`, and you print error messages using `console.error('Error adding feedback:', error.message);`, providing more context about the error.

Overall, Axios can help streamline and simplify your network requests, making your code more readable and maintainable, especially in larger projects. It also provides several features that can be useful in real-world applications.

### Advantages of Fetch over Axios

While Axios offers several advantages over the native `fetch` API, there are situations where `fetch` might be preferred or advantageous:

1. **Built-in Browser Support**: The native `fetch` API is built into modern web browsers, which means you don't need to include an external library like Axios. If you're building a small project with minimal HTTP requests, using `fetch` can reduce the bundle size.

2. **Promises**: Both `fetch` and Axios return Promises, making them easy to work with in modern JavaScript. If you're comfortable with Promises and don't need the extra features provided by Axios, `fetch` can be sufficient for basic use cases.

3. **Simplicity**: For simple GET requests where you only need to fetch data from an API, `fetch` can be more straightforward due to its minimalistic API. You can quickly make a GET request without needing to configure headers or interceptors.

4. **Learning Curve**: For developers who are already familiar with Promises and want to avoid adding extra dependencies to their projects, sticking with `fetch` might be more convenient.

5. **Lightweight**: If you're concerned about the size of your project and want to minimize the number of external dependencies, using `fetch` can help keep your codebase smaller.

6. **Standardization**: As a native browser API, `fetch` adheres closely to web standards. This might be an advantage in projects where strict adherence to standards is crucial.

7. **ES6 Features**: `fetch` is integrated with ES6 features like Promises and arrow functions, making it suitable for modern JavaScript development.

While `fetch` has its advantages, it's important to note that Axios was created to address many of the limitations and complexities of `fetch`, making it more powerful and developer-friendly for a wide range of use cases. The choice between `fetch` and Axios ultimately depends on the specific requirements of your project and your familiarity with the APIs. For complex applications or when you need advanced features like interceptors, request cancellation, or error handling, Axios often proves to be the more practical choice.

## Installation

To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-front-to-back`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Usage

The code snippet below illustrates the process of acquiring identical code from this repository onto your local machine.

```bash
# Clone the remote Git repository
git clone https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back.git

# Change the current directory to the cloned repository's directory
cd react-front-to-back

# Install project dependencies using npm
npm install

# Start the application server
npm start

# List all remote branches
git branch -r

# Switch to a specific branch (replace <branch-name> with the desired branch name)
git checkout <branch-name> # for example: git checkout 35-refactor
```

The provided commands are used to clone a remote Git repository, navigate to the cloned repository's directory, install its dependencies, start the application server, list remote branches, and switch to a specific branch.

Here's a breakdown of each command:

1. `git clone https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back.git`: This command clones the remote Git repository from the URL `https://github.com/techstackmedia/react-front-to-back` to your local machine. It creates a new directory named `react-front-to-back.git` and copies the entire repository contents into that directory.

2. `cd react-front-to-back.git`: This command changes the current working directory to the `react-front-to-back.git` directory. After executing this command, you will be inside the project directory.

3. `npm install`: This command installs the dependencies required by the application. It reads the `package.json` file in the project directory and installs all the packages listed in the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections.

4. `npm start`: This command starts the application server. The specific behavior of this command depends on how it is configured in the `package.json` file. Typically, it will run the application server and make it accessible at a specific port, allowing you to interact with the application in your web browser.

5. `git branch -r`: This command lists all the remote branches in the Git repository. Remote branches are branches that exist on the remote repository (in this case, on GitHub) and not on your local machine.

6. `git checkout <branch-name>`: This command is used to switch to a specific branch. Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to switch to. After executing this command, you will be on the specified branch, and you can start working on that branch.

In summary, these commands are commonly used to clone a Git repository, set up a local development environment by installing dependencies, start the application server, and switch to a specific branch to work on a particular feature or bug fix.

## Issue

In case you come across the error "Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'package-name' in 'your/path/here'", address this by running the command `npm install` (and consider restarting the development server if needed). This action will guarantee the installation of the required dependencies, successfully resolving the issue.
